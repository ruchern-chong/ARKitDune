# ARKit Dune

This repository contains the code written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) by Apple for an Augmented Reality (AR) application using [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) on iOS. 

This application was demonstrated and presented in a B2B event at the [Millennial 20/20 Asia](https://www.eventnook.com/event/millennial2020asiapacific2017) held at the Marina Bay Art Science Museum, Singapore in 2017. This showcase was about exploring the immersive technologies in its infancy stage.
